Smart Financial Planner — Claro v5

Follows professional financial planning methodology:
  Stage 1: Mini emergency buffer (£1,000 or 1 month essentials)
  Stage 2: Clear ALL debt aggressively
  Stage 3: Full emergency fund (3 months essentials)
  Stage 4: Goals by deadline urgency
  Stage 5: Long-term goals

The user provides 5%. The planner does 95%.

    Floor contract:
      • A user-set monthly_allocation (from the Goal model) is a hard
        commitment, not a hint. The engine respects it even when it
        exceeds the engine's own monthly_need inference — user intent
        overrides engine inference.
      • Each floor is capped at the goal's _remaining (target - current)
        so we never over-fund a goal beyond completion.
      • If the sum of floors exceeds available surplus, every floor is
        scaled down by the same factor so the sum fits. We never error
        on over-committed floors; we proportionally honour them.

    Must-hit goals are excluded by design — they receive exact-deadline-need
    allocation in STAGE 0 of _staged_allocation and never enter the pool.
    Applying floors to must-hits would over-fund and break the deadline math.

    Mutates each pot:
      • monthly_amount += effective_floor
      • _user_floor    = effective_floor   (preserved for later caps)

    Why snowball: when every member of the tie group shares the same weight,
    the cross-group proportional split mathematically produces the same
    completion month for every goal (months_i = total_remaining / available).
    Snowball-on-tie breaks that degeneracy by sequencing rather than
    proportionalising within the tie.

    Tie-break order: (_remaining, priority_rank, goal_id) — deterministic
    across plan regenerations so downstream consumers (whisper_service,
    get_plan_summary) see consistent "nearest goal" picks.

    The user-set floor portion is locked in and never reassigned. Only the
    proportional excess above each pot's floor is redistributed.

    Leftover handling: once every tie member is at its monthly_need cap,
    any surplus inside the snowball budget flows to lifestyle. This
    preserves the sum=surplus invariant and matches the leftover handling
    already in _staged_allocation. Going beyond monthly_need is Phase 2
