# Claro (Fintrack) — Agent Rules

Project-specific rules for Claude working on this codebase. These are not design standards — they are Claro-specific patterns, gotchas, and architectural decisions.

---

## MANDATORY: Read DESIGN-SYSTEM.md before writing any UI

Before writing or editing any template, read `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`. It defines every visual pattern: typography, colour, cards, spacing, buttons, forms, icons, navigation, data display, animation. AGENTS.md handles dev/routing rules. DESIGN-SYSTEM.md handles visual decisions.

---

## MANDATORY: When fixing a pattern, check everywhere that pattern appears

Victoria will point out one instance of an issue. Your job is to find and fix ALL instances across the entire app. Never fix only the reported occurrence.

Steps:
1. Grep the entire `app/templates/` directory for the pattern (class name, element type, query param, copy string)
2. Audit every match — same issue may appear in different forms on different pages
3. Fix all instances in a single pass
4. Verify each affected page with Playwright

Examples:
- Breadcrumb shows wrong back-link on one page → audit ALL sub-pages with breadcrumbs
- Navigation active state wrong in one context → check ALL nav conditions in base.html
- Icon wrong in one template → find all uses of that icon across templates

---

## MANDATORY: Propagate navigation context through every hop

When a user follows a link that carries `?from=X`, every subsequent link on that page must carry the same context forward. Never drop navigation context mid-chain.

Pattern:
- Overview → goal_detail?from=overview → edit_goal?from=overview → (breadcrumb shows full trail)
- Plan → goal_detail?from=plan → edit_goal?from=plan → (breadcrumb shows full trail)

Rules:
1. Any page that reads `request.args.get('from')` must also pass it forward on outbound links
2. Breadcrumbs must be multi-level — always show the full trail from origin, not just one step back
3. Never hardcode a breadcrumb destination if the page has multiple entry points

---

## MANDATORY: Check existing instances before changing any UI element

Before editing any UI element (button style, badge, icon, label, card type, spacing value, colour token), find at least 2 other places in the app where that same element appears. Match them exactly. Never introduce a new style for an existing semantic role.

Steps:
1. Grep for the element class or token across `app/templates/`
2. Read 2+ instances to understand the established pattern
3. Your change must match that pattern — not invent a new one
4. If no existing pattern exists, check DESIGN-SYSTEM.md for the spec before writing anything

This prevents visual drift. One-off treatments that look fine in isolation break the system at scale.

---

## MANDATORY: Playwright verification after every UI change

**After any change to a template or CSS — run Playwright and screenshot before marking the task done.**

This is not optional. Do not say "done" without Playwright verification. Static code analysis is not sufficient.

Steps:
1. Navigate to the affected page(s) via Playwright MCP
2. Screenshot at 375px and 1440px minimum
3. Review the screenshots visually — check hierarchy, alignment, card usage, colour, spacing
4. Fix anything that looks wrong
5. Then mark done

The server runs on **port 5001**. Log in via Playwright browser (separate cookie jar from host browser).

---

## Dev environment

- Flask runs on **port 5001** (not the default 5000). Always use `http://localhost:5001`.
- Playwright screenshots use a separate cookie jar — log in via the browser tool, not the host browser session.

---

## Template status

These templates exist in `app/templates/` but are **NOT served by any route**. Do not edit them unless explicitly asked:

- `dashboard.html`
- `budgets.html`
- `goals.html`
- `simulator.html`
- `waterfall.html`

Active templates: `overview`, `my_money`, `my_goals`, `plan`, `my_budgets`, `settings`, `factfind`, `surplus_reveal`, `goal_chips`, `plan_reveal`, `plan_review`, `upload`, `add_transaction`, `add_goal`, `edit_goal`, `goal_detail`, `scenario`, `analytics`, `insights`, `recurring`, `checkin`, `companion`, `welcome`, `login`, `register`, `unsubscribe`.

---

## Navigation active states

- The Settings tab active state must only match `pages.settings`. **Never include `pages.factfind`** — factfind is a standalone onboarding flow, not a Settings sub-page. Including it causes the Settings tab to illuminate when users are on factfind.
- Bottom nav has 5 tabs: Overview, Check-in, Goals, Companion, Plan.

**`?from=` context — bilateral rule.** When a sub-page carries `?from=X`, the nav active state must reflect X, not the endpoint's natural parent. Changes are always bilateral: (a) remove the arrival page from the "natural parent" condition, AND (b) add it explicitly to the "source" tab. Doing only one side leaves no tab active.

| `?from=` value | Active tab | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| `?from=plan` | Plan | `goal_detail`, `edit_goal` |
| `?from=overview` | Overview | `goal_detail` |
| anything else | Goals | `goal_detail`, `my_goals`, `add_goal`, `edit_goal` |

The `base.html` Goals condition must include `and request.args.get('from') != 'overview'`. The Overview condition must include `or (request.endpoint == 'pages.goal_detail' and request.args.get('from') == 'overview')`.

---

## Mobile header bar

- **Layout**: `.mobile-header-bar` is a fixed bar (52px + safe area), `justify-content: space-between`, `padding: 0 16px`. Logo on LEFT, avatar on RIGHT.
- **Logo**: `<a class="mobile-logo">` with `<img style="height:24px;width:auto;">`. PNG is landscape (636×334) — set height only, let width auto. Do NOT match the avatar circle height (36px): the logo mark is optically denser. 24px in a 52px bar gives 14px clear space each side. The avatar letter inside its 36px circle reads much smaller — do not use the circle container as the optical reference.
- **Avatar** (`.mobile-settings-btn`): `position: static` inside the bar on mobile. `viewport-fit=cover` is set in the viewport meta — use `env(safe-area-inset-top)` aware positioning for the bar itself.
- Main content top padding: `max(16px, calc(env(safe-area-inset-top) + 10px))`. Do not add `padding-top` to page-header or this alignment breaks.
- Avatar bottom edge: ~50px (no notch) / ~77px (notch). To push a sub-row (count + CTA) below the avatar zone: increase `margin-bottom` on the page-header. Never use `padding-top` on the header (breaks alignment) or `padding-right` on the sub-row (misaligns right edge with surrounding content).
- Pages with a back-link (`← Goals` etc.) above the header get natural clearance automatically.

---

## Post-action routing

| Action | Routes to |
|---|---|
| Add transaction | `my_money` |
| Add goal | `my_goals` |
| Factfind save | `overview` |
| Upload statement | stays on `upload` (show the wow moment) |
| Edit goal save | `my_goals` |
| Delete budget | stays on `my_budgets` |

---

## CSS rules — forbidden patterns

- **Spacing token system**: The canonical scale is `--sp-xs: 4px; --sp-sm: 8px; --sp-md: 16px; --sp-lg: 24px; --sp-xl: 32px; --sp-2xl: 48px;`. The old `--space-*` system was removed. Always use `--sp-*` for new spacing declarations. Never reintroduce `--space-*`.
- **`[style*="..."]` attribute substring selectors**: never use. They silently match every element with that inline style fragment across the entire codebase. Example of what broke: `[style*="display: flex"][style*="gap: 12px"] { flex-direction: column }` forced column layout on every flex row with gap:12px, including the My Money sub-nav. Use CSS classes or explicit inline styles instead.
- **Duplicate CSS class definitions**: if a class is defined twice in main.css, the second wins and silently overrides the first. Before adding a new class block, grep first. Root cause of all empty-state centering inconsistencies was a second `.empty-state` definition with `text-align: center; padding: 40px 20px` overriding the correct first definition.

---

## JavaScript — SVG elements

- SVG elements expose `className` as a read-only `SVGAnimatedString`, not a writable `DOMString`.
- **Never**: `svgElement.className = 'some-class'` — throws TypeError.
- **Always**: `svgElement.setAttribute('class', 'some-class')` or `svgElement.classList.add('some-class')`.

---

## Currency formatting (Jinja2)

- **Always**: `"{:,.2f}".format(value)` — includes thousands comma separator.
- **Never**: `"%.2f" | format(value)` — no comma, produces "£1471.68" instead of "£1,471.68".
- Negative amounts: `−£{{ "{:,.2f}".format(val|abs) }}` — Unicode minus (U+2212) before `£`, never `£-X.XX`.

---

## Auth pages

`glass-card` is acceptable on login and register pages. These pages have no app chrome (no sidebar, no bottom nav), so the form needs a visual container. This is the **only** exception to the no-card-on-forms rule.

---

## Button hierarchy — one primary per page

- Exactly **one** `btn-primary` (gold filled) per page. Never two simultaneously.
- Inline save/edit actions (e.g. inline budget limit save) → `btn-secondary`.
- Calculator/tool actions that don't submit to the server → `btn-secondary`.
- Forms that create or commit data → `btn-primary`.
- Post-action navigational buttons ("View full plan") → `btn-secondary`.

---

## Colour semantics

- **Gold (`--roman-gold`)** only on: primary CTAs, goal highlights, AI insight headers, savings progress bars, projections on track.
- Gold **not** on: neutral informational display values, "available for goals", tier labels, avatar backgrounds.
- **Green (`--success`)** only on actual monetary gains — never on opportunity costs, potential savings, or lost growth projections.
- **Avatar / identity**: must use neutral glass — `rgba(255,255,255,0.07)` dark, `rgba(0,0,0,0.05)` light. Light-theme overrides live in `themes.css` under each `body.theme-*` selector.

---

## Theme-aware CSS tokens

- **`--progress-track`**: dark fallback defined in `:root` as `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`. Light themes override in `body.theme-*` selector in `themes.css`. **Minimum opacity on light themes is `rgba(0,0,0,0.12)`** — `0.08` is optically invisible on white cards and looks like a render glitch. All 4 light themes (Paper, Ivory, Pearl, Sage) must use `0.12` or higher.
- **`--shadow-float`**, **`--shadow-float-lg`**, **`--shadow-toast`**: shadow tokens for floating surfaces (popover, custom select dropdown, flatpickr calendar, toast). Dark default in `:root` uses `rgba(0,0,0,0.45+)` for depth. All 6 light themes override in a single grouped selector in `themes.css` to `rgba(0,0,0,0.08–0.10)` — soft, not harsh. Always use these tokens; never hardcode shadow rgba values on floating components.
- Pattern for any luminance-dependent value: `:root` = dark default, `body.theme-*` = light override. Never hardcode `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)` directly in templates or component CSS.
- When a new floating component is added, use `box-shadow: var(--shadow-float)` (or `--shadow-float-lg` for larger surfaces like datepickers). The token automatically adjusts for all 9 themes.

---

## Card usage

- `glass-card` **only** on: discrete financial objects the user acts on as a whole — goal cards, budget rows, transaction lists, metric grids, recurring item lists.
- `gold-card` **only** on: AI insight blocks.
- Forms → bare on page background (except login/register).
- Empty states, paywall teasers, cross-page CTAs → bare.
- Section separators → spacing + typography only, not containers.

---

## Profile popover (sidebar)

- Sign-out lives in the Claude-style profile popover — never as a standalone sidebar button.
- Trigger: `.sidebar-profile-trigger` button in `.sidebar-footer { position: relative }`.
- Panel: `.profile-popover` with `position: absolute; bottom: calc(100% + 8px); left: 0; right: 0` — floats above the trigger.
- JS pattern: `stopPropagation()` on trigger click; `document.click` closes if outside; `Escape` key closes and returns focus.

---

## Button icon rule

- All CTA buttons and links use **Lucide SVG icons** inline — never Unicode characters (`→`, `←`, `▶`).
- Forward CTAs: Lucide `chevron-right` (`<path d="M9 18l6-6-6-6"/>`) at `width="14" height="14"`.
- Back links: Lucide `chevron-left` (`<path d="m15 18-6-6 6-6"/>`) at `width="10" height="10"`.
- Button layout: `display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; gap: 8px;` — icon is the last child.
- JS-generated button icons: use `document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'svg')` — never `innerHTML` or `textContent` with SVG strings.

---

## Onboarding wizard

- The 4-step wizard is: `factfind` (step 1) → `surplus_reveal` (step 2) → `goal_chips` (step 3) → `plan_reveal` (step 4) → `plan_review` → `overview`.
- **One progress system**: step bars live only in the wizard pages. Do not add a second progress tracker (e.g. a 2-step checklist on overview or welcome) — competing systems confuse users.
- Step bar layout: `[chevron Back] [bars flex:1] [Step X of 4]` — Back on the LEFT, counter on the RIGHT.
- AI whisper (gold-card) placement: **only on `plan_review`** (before the allocation breakdown). Never on `plan_reveal` — reveal moments are clean.
- The overview no-goals nudge links to `/goals/choose` (wizard), not `/add-goal` (manual form).

---

## Navigation chevron rule

- `>` (chevron-right) icon on a link/button = navigates away from the current page to a different route.
- Form submit buttons = no icon.
- Secondary tool/calculator actions = no icon.
- Consistent across all pages — do not mix icon/no-icon on semantically equivalent actions.

---

## Bottom nav (mobile)

- **5 tabs**: Overview, Check-in, Goals, Companion, Plan. (Money tab was removed in the nav restructure.)

---

## Registration routing

- New users after registration → `/factfind` directly (step 1 of 4 onboarding wizard).
- The `/welcome` page still exists and is reachable but is **not** part of the new-user flow.
- Do not re-add the welcome redirect — the wizard handles full onboarding including goal setup.

---

## USER MENTAL MODEL

Run these checks before calling any page done.

- Before calling any page done, ask: does the user know what they're looking at?
- Does every label match the user's mental model, not the developer's model? ("Your goals" not "From your surplus", "Your timeline" not "Plan phases")
- Is every piece of information useful or is it creating cognitive overhead?
- Is the hierarchy obvious: primary action, secondary info, supporting detail?
- Could a user unfamiliar with the product understand this page in 10 seconds?
- Does the empty state tell the user WHAT the page will look like when populated?

---

## UI audit — what to check on every page

Run these checks before marking any UI change done. Static analysis is not enough — use Playwright for visual verification.

**Alignment**
- Page headers (`h1`, `.page-header`) are always **left-aligned**. No centering exceptions, not even for "reveal moments" or emotional milestones.
- All body text, labels, and form fields are left-aligned. `text-align: center` is only valid for footer disclaimer notes (e.g. guidance/legal copy below a CTA). Grep check: `grep -n "text-align: center" templates/`.

**Section order**
- Standard page order: back-link (if applicable) → step bar (onboarding only) → page-header → onboarding nudge (if factfind incomplete) → primary content → secondary/explanatory content → CTA.
- Never put explanatory methodology text above financial data. Data first, explanation below.

**Card usage**
- `glass-card` only on discrete financial objects the user acts on as a whole (goal cards, budget rows, transaction lists, metric grids). See Card usage section.
- Analysis summaries, plan overview numbers, methodology text, and empty states must be **bare** (no card wrapper).
- If content explains HOW something works rather than WHAT the user's data is, it does not get a card.

**Text hierarchy**
- Section labels: `.section-label` class — uppercase, letter-spaced, `var(--text-tertiary)`, small size.
- Primary data values: `var(--text-primary)`, `font-weight: 500` or `600`.
- Supporting copy: `var(--text-secondary)`, `0.8rem–0.85rem`.
- Tertiary/helper copy: `var(--text-tertiary)`, `0.75rem–0.78rem`.
- Never use `font-style: italic` outside `gold-card` blocks.
- Never uppercase body copy or data values — only section-label elements.

**Colour consistency**
- Gold (`--roman-gold`) is NOT a general highlight colour. See Colour semantics section.
- All gold in templates must flow from `var(--roman-gold)` or `var(--roman-gold-dim)` — never hardcoded `rgba(197,163,93,...)`.
- Do not use `--success` (green) for anything that is not a real monetary gain.
- Step bars in onboarding wizard: `rgba(255,255,255,0.25)` filled, `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` unfilled. Never gold.

**Icons and emoji**
- Zero emojis anywhere in templates OR service/route files.
- All icons are inline Lucide SVGs. Icon names in service files must match the Jinja2 mapping in `overview.html`. When adding new icon names, update both the service AND the template mapping simultaneously.
- Decorative icons above `h1` headings are prohibited. If the `h1` already communicates the meaning (e.g. "Your plan is ready."), a preceding icon is redundant noise — remove it.

**Button vocabulary**
- Valid classes: `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-danger` + modifiers `btn-sm`, `btn-full`. Nothing else.
- NEVER create a custom button class for a one-off variant (e.g. `.withdraw-preset`, `.section-cta`, anything pill-shaped for an action trigger).
- `btn-secondary` is only valid alongside a `btn-primary` on the same surface. If `btn-secondary` would be the only interactive element on a section, use `btn-primary` instead.
- Selection chips (`.goal-chip`, `.sub-chip`, `.suggestion-chip`) are intentionally pill-shaped. Pill shape on action buttons (triggers, CTAs, navigation) is a violation.

**Section CTAs**
- Navigational links in section header rows (e.g. "My goals ›", "My money ›") must use `<a class="btn-secondary btn-sm">`. Never a custom class, never plain anchor text.
- These are always right-aligned beside the section label: `display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;` on the header row.

**Affordance — interactive list homogeneity**
- Lists must be all-tappable or all-non-tappable. Never mix tappable and non-tappable rows in the same list — on mobile (no hover state), users cannot distinguish them.
- If only some items in a list are actionable, either: (a) remove the non-actionable items from that list, or (b) move them to a separate, clearly non-interactive section.
- Tappable rows: `display: block`, chevron icon right-aligned, `color: var(--text-primary)`, `text-decoration: none`.

**Centering islands**
- No `max-width + margin: 0 auto` wrapper on full-width page content. This creates a centered layout island inconsistent with all other pages.
- Run `grep -rn "margin: 0 auto" templates/` to catch violations. Exceptions: form wrappers on desktop-only utility pages (factfind, upload) where the form is genuinely narrow.

**Colour — hardcoded rgba**
- All gold values must use CSS variables, never hardcoded `rgba(197,163,93,...)` — this breaks theme switching.
- Required `:root` variables for gold: `--roman-gold`, `--roman-gold-dim`, `--roman-gold-glow`, `--gold-whisper-bg`, `--gold-whisper-border`.
- When adding a new CSS variable, always add it to `:root` in `main.css` first, then add theme overrides in `themes.css` for ivory and cobalt.

**Empty and unreachable states**
- All empty, error, and unreachable states follow the same pattern: heading (`0.95rem`, `var(--text-primary)`, `font-weight: 500`) + subtitle (`0.82rem`, `var(--text-secondary)`) + `btn-primary btn-sm`. No exceptions.
- "Unreachable" states (goal has no contribution set, feature locked, etc.) are not exempt from this pattern.

**Audit scope**
- When a violation is found, fix it everywhere in the app — not just on the one page that prompted the audit. Run a grep and check all templates.
- Do not ask for direction on violations with established fixes. Hardcoded rgba, text-align center, missing btn class — these have clear, documented fixes. Apply them.

---

## Copy rules

- Zero em dashes (—) anywhere — in templates AND service/route files. Use commas, full stops, or `·` midpoints.
- Button labels: present-tense verb ("Set budget", "Record transaction").
- Status labels: normal case ("on track", "over budget") — never "ON TRACK".
- No parenthetical amounts generated by backend (e.g. `(£250/month)` inline).
- No ML confidence scores or model internals exposed.

---

## Italic rule

- `font-style: italic` only inside `gold-card` blocks (AI insight/prediction/summary copy).
- Not on: instruction text, supporting sub-headings, glass-card body copy, hints, or footer notes (use `var(--text-tertiary)` + small font-size instead).
- Acceptable exception: very short tertiary-coloured UI hints (e.g. factfind helper notes, upload hints) where italic signals "this is supplementary context, not a field label."

---

## Progress bar component

- Always use the `.progress-track` CSS class for the container — never inline `height`, `background`, `border-radius`, `overflow` that duplicates the class.
- Use `.progress-fill` for the inner bar — add `background` inline only when the colour is semantic (gold for goals, custom colour for analytics categories, muted for calendar/time progress).
- Height overrides via inline `style="height: Npx"` are allowed when the bar has different semantic weight (e.g. 4px for secondary budget rows, 8px for hero goal detail, 3px for decorative inline bars).
- Do not use `opacity` on `.progress-fill` — use a lower-alpha colour value instead.

---

## Status badge colour map

| Status | Badge class |
|---|---|
| On track, no action needed | `badge-default` |
| Healthy (positive health indicator) | `badge-success` |
| Below average spending (good) | `badge-success` |
| Tight / caution | `badge-warning` |
| Above average / over budget / danger | `badge-danger` |
| Neutral count / tier label | `badge-default` |

---

## Onboarding nudge (factfind incomplete banner)

- Always positioned **immediately after the `page-header` block**, before any content cards or sections.
- Never sandwiched between content sections — it must be the first thing a user sees on the page.
- Appears on: `overview`, `my_money`, `my_budgets`, `settings`.
- Component: tappable row, `background: rgba(197,163,93,0.07)`, gold border, gold info icon, chevron right.

---

## Empty state rules

Two tiers — use the right one based on context:

**Full-page empty states** (the page has nothing else to show — Goals with no goals, Check-in locked, Companion paywall, 404, 500): use `.empty-page-center` class. Horizontally + vertically centred, centred text, max-width 280px on `<p>` elements.

**Section-level empty states** (within a page that has other content — Overview "No transactions yet", Plan "Build your plan" with calculators below): use `padding: 8px 0 32px`, left-aligned.

Both tiers require the same anatomy:
- Headline: `font-size: 0.95rem; color: var(--text-primary); font-weight: 500; margin-bottom: 8px`
- Subtext: `font-size: 0.8rem; color: var(--text-tertiary); line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 20px`
- CTA: `btn-primary btn-sm`
- Never wrap in a card or container.
- Subtext answers: why is this empty + what should the user do.

---

## Form patterns

- **Cancel button rule**: Every form that creates or edits data must have Cancel next to the primary submit button. Cancel is always a plain text element styled as `font-size: 0.82rem; color: var(--text-tertiary); text-decoration: none;` in a flex container with `gap: 14px`. For `<a>` elements use anchor tag; for inline accordion forms use `<button type="button">` with matching inline styles. Never use `btn-secondary` for Cancel.
- **Form label rule**: Every `<input>` must have an associated `<label class="form-label">`. For ledger-style inputs (checkin, inline edit), add `for`/`id` pair even when the label is visually part of the row.
- **Button sizing rule**: Submit buttons on full-page standalone forms use `.btn-primary` (standard size) — never `.btn-sm`. Exception: compact inline sub-forms inside accordions (e.g. settings change-email, change-password panels) may use `.btn-primary.btn-sm` because the compact context demands it. Calculator/tool actions that don't commit data use `.btn-secondary.btn-sm`.
- **Placeholder format**: Number inputs use `"e.g. 250"` or `"e.g. 1700"` format. Text inputs use descriptive examples.
- **Accordion form sub-headers**: Do not add an inner sub-header repeating the accordion's own title. The accordion trigger IS the header. If a panel contains only one form, go straight to the fields.
- **Settings Account accordion**: Account and Security/Password are merged into a single "Account" accordion. Inside, use inline-edit rows — read-only by default, one row expands at a time via `toggleEdit(field)`. Never show forms by default. Three editable fields: Name (pre-filled with current value), Email (empty input, confirm password required), Password (3-field change form). Member since is read-only. Backend route `update_account` handles `change_name`, `change_email`, `change_password` form types.

---

## Mobile-specific patterns

- **Sign out**: Only available via sidebar profile popover on desktop. On mobile (≤768px), settings.html shows a sign-out button at the bottom of the page using `.mobile-only` class. Desktop keeps it in popover only.
- **`.mobile-only`**: `display: none` by default, `display: block` at ≤768px.
- **`.desktop-only`**: `display: block` by default, `display: none` at ≤768px.

---

## Popover colour tokens

- `--popover-bg` is NOT neutral `#1c1c1e` — each dark theme has its own hue-matched elevated surface:
  - `theme-racing-green`: `#101e15`
  - `theme-midnight-navy`: `#0d1620`
  - `theme-oxford-saddle`: `#1a1008`
  - `theme-amethyst`: `#14091e`
  - `theme-rosso`: `#1a0808`
  - `theme-cobalt`: `#0c1220`
- Light themes use their respective solid surface colours.
- Applies to: profile popover, custom select dropdown, flatpickr calendar.
